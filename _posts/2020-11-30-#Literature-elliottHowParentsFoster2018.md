## Overview

1. Factors that foster math learning during early childhood
    - home numeracy environment
        - math contents at home
        - parent's practices (instruction, autonomy support, affective support etc.)
2. Home numeracy environment vs. Home literacy environment
    - results of HNE study are inconsistent and messy
    - measures for HNE are not fully developed 
    - HNM is relatively infrequent
4. Looking ahead
    - alternative conceptualizations of the home numeracy environment
    - bring in parents' and children's characteristics
    - effects of interventions

**Things to go through in this review paper**

1. We briefly describe studies addressing associations between parents’ practices and children’s early math skills, including how researchers have conceptualized the home numeracy environment. 
2. We discuss methodological limits of this work and possible alternative approaches to measuring the home numeracy environment. 
3. We conclude by discussing remaining questions and directions for research.


## Established findings

1. Early math skills are among the strongest predictors of later academic achievement[@duncanSchoolReadinessLater2007].


## Mixed findings

#### parenting practices 
Research addressing parents’ influences on children’s math skills is in its infancy[@saxeSocialProcessesEarly1987]. As a result, we know less about the parenting practices that might foster young children’s knowledge about math.

#### HNM -> children's early math skills
Studies examining links between the home numeracy environment and children’s early math skills have yielded inconsistent results.

> several finding no relation between measures of the home numeracy environment and children’s math skills [@deflorioSocioeconomicStatusPreschoolers2015;@missallHomeNumeracyEnvironments2015], and others detecting positive associations [@kleemansChildHomePredictors2012;@niklasCastingCastImportance2014].

The directionality of associations between the home numeracy environment and children’s math learning is often untested.

#### Global measures of the home numeracy environment 

Check what measures each study used to find out possible explanations for the mixed findings

- A small but growing number of studies have found unique and positive associations between global measures of the home numeracy environment and 4- to 7-year-olds’ math abilities [@kleemansChildHomePredictors2012;@niklasCastingCastImportance2014;@dearingYoungGirlsArithmetic2012;@manolitsisExaminingEffectsHome2013]. 
- Only the math-related activities that 4- to 6-year-olds engaged in alone predicted their math skills[@blevins-knabeNumberUseHome1996].
- Another study documented no relation between the home numeracy environment and a variety of numeracy skills among 3- to 5-year-olds [@missallHomeNumeracyEnvironments2015].

4. Formal and informal math activities
Explicitly didactic activities (e.g., using number flash cards or writing numerals) contrasted with informal opportunities to learn math (e.g., playing board games or cooking)
- Only formal activities pre- dicted kindergarteners’ knowledge of numbers [@lefevreHomeNumeracyExperiences2009]
- formal - positive; informal - negative [@huntsingerParentalFacilitationEarly2016]
- formal - significant associations [@niklasCastingCastImportance2014;@manolitsisExaminingEffectsHome2013]; no links [@deflorioSocioeconomicStatusPreschoolers2015;@blevins-knabeNumberUseHome1996]

#### Methodological limits
 - parents' reports of activities: parents are susceptible to biases of social desirability; have difficulty accurately identifying math-related activities in the home.
 - A valid scale: identify board games from a checklist of 25 titles [@skwarchukFormalInformalHome2014]
 - math-related language input [@hoffInterpretingEarlyLanguage2013;@levineWhatCountsDevelopment2010]
 - Time-intensive observations of the home numeracy environment [@levineEarlyPuzzlePlay2012;@vandermaas-peelerParentalSupportNumeracy2012]

#### Classification of math activities

@lefevreHomeNumeracyExperiences2009 were among the first to examine dimensions of the home numeracy environment and empirically identified four factors of math activities: 1) informal activities: math games, applications (e.g., everyday activities that involve math); 2) formal activities: activities that develop math skills, and number books.

- Both formal and informal relate to math fluence
- Only informal relates to children's math knowledge

 @skwarchukFormalInformalHome2014 proposed a theoretical model of the home numeracy environment inspired by home literacy environment modeling [@senechalParentalInvolvementDevelopment2002], whereby engaging in formal math activities would promote the development of symbolic math knowledge, whereas informal practices would foster nonsymbolic math skills. 

However, such efforts to resolve past inconsistencies in the development of math skills by testing separate formal and informal associations of the home numeracy environment with distinct math skills have been largely unsuccessful.

 - subsequent research has rarely replicated the theorized divergent validity of these formal and informal pathways of the home numeracy environment with early math skills.

 Advanced HNM vs. Basic HNM?

#### Other dimensions of HNM

 - Activities in the home numeracy environment differ qualitatively depending on their complexity.

 - Parent and child characteristics
    - child skills
    - SES

> SES positively predicts informal math activities but not formal math activities [@deflorioSocioeconomicStatusPreschoolers2015], whereas associations between the home numeracy environment and children’s achievement surface more consistently for formal math activities than for informal activities.

#### Effects of intervention?
